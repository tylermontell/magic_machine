Key Technical Achievements (Past 4 Days)
1. Script and Configuration Refinements:

model_annual Parsing Script: Adapted for improved XML parsing and row validation. The script now efficiently handles namespace definitions, ensuring smooth data extraction.
config.py Improvements: Streamlined report headers and exclusion rules to handle different financial report types, aligning scripts with varying report structures.
Challenges and Fixes
1. Error Handling:

Issue: Encountered ValueError: 12 columns passed, but passed data had 80 columns. This was due to inconsistent headers across data sources.
Fix: Implemented a header-row validation function to check consistency across data files and resolve the mismatch issue.
2. XML Parsing:

Issue: Namespace inconsistencies were breaking XML parsing across files.
Fix: Applied the lxml.etree library to define namespaces ('ss': 'urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet') consistently in all scripts, ensuring uniform parsing.
3. Row Length Validation:

Issue: Mismatched row lengths caused crashes during processing.
Fix: Implemented a row validation function that appends empty strings for shorter rows, ensuring all rows match the expected number of headers.
Lessons Learned
1. XML Namespace Handling:

Properly defining namespaces in XML parsing helped avoid unnecessary data extraction errors and made the scripts more robust.
2. Validation Strategy:

Implementing upfront validation for row lengths and exclusions greatly reduced crashes and improved overall performance.
3. Data Deduplication:

Using Pythonâ€™s set() function effectively removed duplicate rows, streamlining data processing.
Recommendations for Automation and Future Work
1. Automate Row Validation:

Integrate automated checks to ensure row lengths match headers before any processing begins. This will prevent mismatches and improve the integrity of data.
2. Data Consistency Checks:

Automate validation for consistency across different file types (.xls and .html), ensuring data is uniform and structured before further analysis.
3. Debugging Tips:

Log any discrepancies in columns or invalid data types early in the process to streamline debugging and reduce runtime crashes.
Next Steps
1. Adapt for model_compare Report Type:

Modify headers in config.py to handle model_compare structure.
Adjust row processing logic to account for differences in fund names, dates, and return data.
Reuse components from model_annual to manage common functionalities like data cleaning and namespace handling.
2. HTML Parsing Testing:

Begin by developing test cases with diverse data:
Missing Data: How the parser handles missing fields like fund names or dates.
Mixed Formats: Ensure parsing logic adapts to varied HTML structures.
Edge Cases: Test large data tables or unusual special characters to ensure robustness.
3. Build Automated Validation Routines:

Incorporate automated validation routines as part of the pre-processing phase. This will streamline error handling and reduce trial-and-error efforts in future sessions.

Code Snippets for Key Fixes

# Exclusion Rule Update in config.py
if cell.startswith("Aggregate:"):
    continue  # Skip rows starting with 'Aggregate:'

# XML Namespace Fix in XML Parsing
namespaces = {'ss': 'urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet'}
rows = root.xpath('//ss:Row', namespaces=namespaces)

# Row Length Validation
def validate_row_lengths(data, headers):
    for row in data:
        if len(row) < len(headers):
            row.extend([''] * (len(headers) - len(row)))  # Fill missing columns with empty values
